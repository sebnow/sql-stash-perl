NAME
    SQL::Stash - A stash for SQL queries

SYNOPSIS
            package SQL::Stash::Foo;
            use base qw(SQL::Stash);
            __PACKAGE__->stash('select_foo', 'SELECT * FROM Foo');
            1;

            package main;
            my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:SQLite:dbname=:memory:', '', '');
            my $stash = SQL::Stash::Foo->new();
            my $sth = $stash->retrieve('select_foo');
            $sth->execute();
            while(my $row = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref()) {
                    print("$_\n") for @$row;
            }

DESCRIPTION
    SQL::Stash is a simple query library for SQL statements. SQL statements
    are populated at the class level. SQL::Stash objects prepare these
    statements as late as possible (i.e. before they are executed).

    SQL::Stash is in concept very similar to Ima::DBI, but differs by having
    instance-specific database handles and statements, and by supporting
    externally defined database handles.

METHODS
  new
            SQL::Stash->new(%args);

    Designated constructor. Instantiates a new SQL::Stash object. The "dbh"
    argument, a DBI-like object, must be provided.

            my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:SQLite:dbname=:memory:', '', '');
            my $stash = SQL::Stash->new('dbh' => $dbh);

  stash
            SQL::Stash::Foo->stash($name, $statement, $should_cache);
            $stash->stash($name, $statement, $should_cache);

    Stash an SQL "statement". The method can be called both on the class and
    instance. If the class method is called the "statement" will be added to
    the global stash. If the instance method is called the "statement" will
    only be added to the instance-specific "stash".

    The "name" is used as an identifier in order to later retrieve it. The
    "should_cache" parameter is optional and specifies whether "prepare()"
    or "prepare_cached()" is used to prepare the "statement". It defaults to
    "true".

            SQL::Stash::Foo->stash('select_foo', 'SELECT * FROM Foo');

  retrieve
            $stash->retrieve($name);

    Prepare the statement stored via stashed, identified by "name", and
    return a prepared statement handle.
